# WallCrawl

**Version:** 1.00

## Information

I've taken a simply Perl script I had for downloading Wallpapers from reddit and re-worked it as a class. It's a bit rough as I've left some things out but it will download most straight image links and most images from Imgur page links (excluding albums at the moment).

## Requirements

* A read-only Imgur api account for the client-ID
* JSON module
